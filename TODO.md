## Retrieval

- [ ] Dense-over-raw stays an explicit reserve lane: even with an oracle
  embedder the zero-lexical-overlap class recovers only 3 of 25 from synthesis
  alone. "No ANN" is not approved until the reserve lane is measured at full
  corpus scale.

## Ingest / Store

- [ ] Codex source unblocked 2026-08-27: rocket-agents gained
  `--allow-partial` (commit `bfa54ec` there) and the full codex export landed
  — 4,356 conversations -> 21,219 records ingested, manifest declares
  `complete:false` with the two >64 MiB rollouts listed. Remaining here: once
  rocket-agents ships the streaming exporter (its TODO), re-export codex
  complete and re-ingest so those two rollouts join the index.
- [~] **The archive's shape will not scale.** Specification agreed 2026-08-31
  with codex over three review rounds and kept at
  `docs/designs/conversation-archive-v2.md`: append-only journal of immutable
  content-addressed batches, observed-remove tombstones, set-reducer
  materialization, threshold compaction publishing a snapshot behind a
  compare-and-swapped `current.json`, a disposable per-writer cursor for
  incremental Atrium ingest, and an incremental capture cache. Measured
  baseline it has to beat, on this machine: one conversation costs 132.36 s and
  ~10.3 GB of archive I/O to publish, while a full capture costs 226.91 s and
  2.78 GB -- capture is the larger term, which the first design missed.
  Implementation is not started; it collides with an in-flight
  `CONVERSATION_SCHEMA_VERSION` 1 -> 2 change in rocket-agents that alters event
  id derivation, and the two migrations should be one verified pass over the
  archive rather than two. Original entry below.
- [ ] One JSONL rewritten in full on
  every import: 2.6 GB -> 3.36 GB in a day, and the 2026-08-31 recovery import
  took roughly 45 minutes to add 3,008 conversations. With an hourly refresh
  that is O(corpus) write amplification per hour to append a handful of
  conversations, and it gets worse monotonically. The archive is meant to hold
  everything forever, so the format has to stop being rewritten whole --
  segment by period or by source, or make append the normal path and the full
  rewrite a compaction. Cross-project: rocket-agents.
- [ ] **Whole conversations that have never entered the archive at all.** The
  codex export declares `complete:false` and skips two rollouts over 64 MiB
  outright; the Windsurf and Trae exporters emit zero conversations; ChatGPT
  and Grok leave no local transcript, so nothing has ever been captured from
  them. Each is filed separately below and in `~/p/rocket-agents/TODO.md`, but
  together they are the answer to "is the archive complete", and today the
  answer is no.

## Synthesis

- [ ] Episode-level synthesis is the heart of the system, not phase 2: dense
  vectors cover only synthesized content, so synthesis quality *is* semantic
  search quality. Measured: 69.3% of sessions contain at least one topic jump,
  so the unit is the episode (cut on human turns + topic change), not the
  session file; 8.3% of sessions exceed 100k tokens (max 5.49M), so the long
  tail needs map-reduce. One-time cost for 8,570 sessions measured at $22-104.
  **Built 2026-08-28** (commit `6263938`): cutter, registry, Max-lane
  producer, `synthesize` + `ingest-synthesis` CLI; verified live; first
  tranche done on the Max lane (383 episodes, 4.7M input tokens -- measured
  cost that triggered the routing change below). Bulk now runs on the agy
  drip loop (`~/.local/share/atrium/synthesis/drip-loop.sh`, quota-aware
  via CodexBar; log `run.log`, passes logged in `drip.log`); a pass aborts
  at the Gemini quota wall instead of grinding failures (commit `cf9a320`).
  2026-08-28 22:50: 13,309 records in registry, 11,835 embedded; a stale
  duplicate run (workers 6, pre-drip orphan) was killed -- it was doubling
  quota burn. **2026-08-30 audit found the drip had produced nothing for a
  day and a quarter, and three defects behind it, all fixed the same day:**
  * The on-disk `active-recipe.json` listed only
    `["codex-cli-default","claude-sonnet-5"]`, so the whole
    `gemini-3.7-flash-medium` population -- 3,686 episodes across 580
    conversations, a quarter of everything synthesized -- was produced and
    then dropped at ingest. Adding it took served coverage from 2,029 to
    **2,609 conversations** and 11,835 to **14,653 records**, with no calls.
  * `drip-quota.py` read only the `Gemini 5-hour` window. That window reports
    `usedPercent 0` with `usageKnown: false` while `Gemini weekly` sits at
    100%, so the probe answered "go now", every pass aborted on its first
    call, and the loop ground for ~18 h logging `failed=10790` with zero
    output. It now reads every Gemini window, treats `usageKnown: false` as
    no evidence of headroom rather than as headroom, and sleeps to the
    furthest reset (cap raised 4 h -> 24 h, since the weekly wall is ~14 h out).
  * The loop had died outright (no process since 08:12) and nothing restarted
    it. It now takes a `mkdir` lock with a stale-pid check -- macOS has no
    `flock(1)` -- so a second start exits instead of doubling the quota burn
    the way the 2026-08-28 orphan did.
  Measured coverage after the fixes: **2,609 of 11,028 archived conversations
  (23.7%)**; 8,419 conversations still unsynthesized. One day of agy work on
  2026-08-28 (13,966 records) spent an entire Google AI Pro *weekly* quota,
  so the remaining corpus is several weekly cycles on that lane alone.
  Remaining: let the drip finish, re-run `ingest-synthesis` + `embed`
  periodically, and spot-check quality with Codex as evaluator. **Design pinned in the 2026-08-27 two-agent
  consult, one amendment by operator directive:**
  * Producer, second amendment (operator, 2026-08-28): the Codex CLI's own
    quota (`--producer codex`, default) after the Max lane measured 4.7M
    input tokens for 383 episodes; the Max lane stays as `--producer max`.
    Populations never mix: the model id is in the job key and the
    active-recipe manifest picks exactly one record per episode at ingest.
    The one-producer-population and codex-as-evaluator clauses of the
    original consult are amended by these operator directives.
  * Segmentation: `episode-texttiling-v1` — turn blocks per human message;
    hard cuts at reset markers; TF-IDF TextTiling over human turns only
    (bilingual ES/EN stopwords), three-turn windows, valley depth > session
    median + 1 MAD, >=2 human turns between cuts; 32k-token ceiling with one
    pinned tokenizer; oversized coherent episodes map-reduce mechanically and
    the map chunks are never retrieval episodes. Deterministic, no LLM and no
    embeddings in the cutter.
  * Storage: immutable content-addressed registry at
    `~/.local/share/atrium/synthesis/` with an atomic active-recipe manifest;
    one designated synthesis writer, other machines consume; synced by the
    dotfiles transport, never the SQLite index.
  * Every record carries the full recipe (archive hashes, episode id +
    ordered event hashes, segmentation fingerprint, provider + exact model
    snapshot, prompt sha256, output schema version, inference params,
    generator version, parent map ids, output sha256). Job key = hash of all
    inputs minus output; same job key with different output hashes is a hard
    divergence error, never resolved by timestamps.
  Only user-approved notes are proposed to brain (a tray, not a dump).
- [ ] Session-start injection: frozen-snapshot discipline (write at session
  close, inject at the *next* session start to preserve prefix cache), budget
  ~170-900 tokens — the mechanism users remember as valuable from memstore;
  the synthesis behind it never existed there (checkpoints were literal
  message tails).

## Observability

> Filed 2026-08-31, from the memstore retirement. Every defect that session
> found had been running silently for days, and none of them were subtle --
> they were invisible because nothing reported the right number.

- [ ] **The canonical archive is only canonical while capture outruns
  deletion.** `AGENTS.md` says anything Atrium cannot rebuild from layer 1 or 3
  is a design defect; layer 1 holds only what was on disk when the exporter
  ran. 7,638 Claude Code sessions were deleted from `~/.claude/projects`
  between exports and were lost from the archive permanently -- they survived
  only inside memstore, the store being retired, and were recovered from it
  hours before deletion. The hourly refresh narrows the window to an hour but
  does not close the class. Either capture becomes event-driven, or the window
  has to be provably shorter than the shortest deletion cycle any provider
  uses, and that number has to be known rather than assumed.

- [ ] **The dotfiles auto-sync manufactures conflicts and leaves them.**
  `com.cristian.sync-all-safe` merges the two machines and commits, but a
  conflict stops it mid-merge and nothing resolves or reports it. One sat
  unresolved from 2026-08-29 until it was found by accident on 2026-08-30, and
  a second appeared within a day of that -- both in `agent-guidance/shared.md`
  and `claude/settings.json`, which are exactly the files that carry agent
  guidance and confirmation rules. A repo left with `UU` paths also blocks
  every later commit, so an unnoticed conflict silently stops the sync
  entirely. It needs to either resolve deterministically, or fail loudly
  enough that someone looks. Cross-project: dotfiles.

## Measurement

- [!] Hand-labeled acceptance set — blocks the measurement phase. The 365/389
  question-answer pairs used so far are machine-extracted and not valid for
  production decisions ("better than memstore" needs a number). Smallest
  unblock: the user labels a stratified question set over the corpus, or
  approves a labeling protocol.
  This is the project's ceiling, and the 2026-08-31 retirement made it
  concrete: every decision that day — which population to serve, which events
  to admit, whether the recovery was worth importing — was settled by counting
  rows, comparing sets and measuring bytes. Not one was settled by whether the
  answers got better. memstore is now switched off on structural evidence
  alone, which is enough to call it an operational replacement and not enough
  to call it an improvement.

## Integrations

- [ ] Thin adapters over the CLI core: MCP server and per-agent hooks.
  Integrating a future agent must be an adapter, never an engine change.
- [ ] Early spike (deliberately promoted from phase 3): ChatGPT and Grok have
  no local transcript — design the remote-export adapter family before the
  local-file assumption hardens.
- [!] Windsurf and Trae remain unindexable at layer 1: the Windsurf exporter
  emits 0 conversations from its 4 database artifacts, and the Trae exporter
  emits VS Code workspace metadata instead of dialogue. Both filed in
  `~/p/rocket-agents/TODO.md`; smallest unblock is fixing those exporters
  (needs authorization to change that repo).

## Security

- [ ] Mark untrusted-origin content and never auto-inject it: brain stores
  saved web articles (third-party text), and a retrieved instruction inside one
  can steer a tool-bearing agent. Tag origin at ingest; requires no restriction
  on the user's own access. (Accepted Codex round-1 warning.)

## Self-improvement

- [ ] Query log, gap detection, and brain proposals — with the durable-state
  contradiction resolved first: layer 2 must stay disposable, so synthesis,
  query log and proposal state either live in brain or in an explicitly
  backed-up sidecar. As designed today a rebuild would erase them.

## Cross-project

- [ ] `rocket-agents`: canonical event IDs are conversation-local in practice —
  `conversationEventFromRecord.ts:20` derives them from `event_index + text`
  with no conversation identity, and real cross-conversation collisions were
  measured (OpenCode, Cursor). Atrium works around it with
  `sha256(conversation_id, event_id)`; the canonical contract should carry the
  identity itself. Also: the Windsurf exporter emits 0 conversations from 4
  database artifacts. Filed in `~/p/rocket-agents/TODO.md`.
- [ ] `memstore` fork: the live palace embeds with the English-only default
  model over a ~77% Spanish corpus; switching to `embeddinggemma` (same 384
  dims, config-only) nearly doubles dense quality (R@10 40.8% -> 70.4%) at
  ~36 h CPU re-embed. Decision pending: worth doing while Atrium replaces it?
  Filed in `~/p/memstore/TODO.md`.
