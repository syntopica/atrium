## Retrieval

- [ ] Dense-over-raw stays an explicit reserve lane: even with an oracle
  embedder the zero-lexical-overlap class recovers only 3 of 25 from synthesis
  alone. "No ANN" is not approved until the reserve lane is measured at full
  corpus scale.

## Ingest / Store

- [ ] Codex source unblocked 2026-08-27: rocket-agents gained
  `--allow-partial` (commit `bfa54ec` there) and the full codex export landed
  — 4,356 conversations -> 21,219 records ingested, manifest declares
  `complete:false` with the two >64 MiB rollouts listed. Remaining here: once
  rocket-agents ships the streaming exporter (its TODO), re-export codex
  complete and re-ingest so those two rollouts join the index.
- [ ] Multi-machine archive sync: the durable archive now lives at
  `~/.local/share/rocket-agents/conversations/archive.jsonl` (decided in the
  2026-08-27 consult; XDG data, 0600/0700, import-verified). Remaining:
  point the dotfiles `sync-conversations` transport at `.local/share`
  (it currently syncs `.local/state`) and prove convergence on the second
  machine with the dry-run-reports-no-changes check. Cross-project: dotfiles.

## Synthesis

- [ ] Episode-level synthesis is the heart of the system, not phase 2: dense
  vectors cover only synthesized content, so synthesis quality *is* semantic
  search quality. Measured: 69.3% of sessions contain at least one topic jump,
  so the unit is the episode (cut on human turns + topic change), not the
  session file; 8.3% of sessions exceed 100k tokens (max 5.49M), so the long
  tail needs map-reduce. One-time cost for 8,570 sessions measured at $22-104.
  Budget approved 2026-08-27. **Design pinned in the 2026-08-27 two-agent
  consult (build to this, re-open only with evidence):**
  * Producer: Claude Batch API only, one exact dated Sonnet-class model ID,
    structured output, no tools; Codex CLI is the independent evaluator and
    never produces baseline records (no mixed populations).
  * Segmentation: `episode-texttiling-v1` — turn blocks per human message;
    hard cuts at reset markers; TF-IDF TextTiling over human turns only
    (bilingual ES/EN stopwords), three-turn windows, valley depth > session
    median + 1 MAD, >=2 human turns between cuts; 32k-token ceiling with one
    pinned tokenizer; oversized coherent episodes map-reduce mechanically and
    the map chunks are never retrieval episodes. Deterministic, no LLM and no
    embeddings in the cutter.
  * Storage: immutable content-addressed registry at
    `~/.local/share/atrium/synthesis/` with an atomic active-recipe manifest;
    one designated synthesis writer, other machines consume; synced by the
    dotfiles transport, never the SQLite index.
  * Every record carries the full recipe (archive hashes, episode id +
    ordered event hashes, segmentation fingerprint, provider + exact model
    snapshot, prompt sha256, output schema version, inference params,
    generator version, parent map ids, output sha256). Job key = hash of all
    inputs minus output; same job key with different output hashes is a hard
    divergence error, never resolved by timestamps.
  Only user-approved notes are proposed to brain (a tray, not a dump).
- [ ] Session-start injection: frozen-snapshot discipline (write at session
  close, inject at the *next* session start to preserve prefix cache), budget
  ~170-900 tokens — the mechanism users remember as valuable from mempalace;
  the synthesis behind it never existed there (checkpoints were literal
  message tails).

## Measurement

- [!] Hand-labeled acceptance set — blocks the measurement phase. The 365/389
  question-answer pairs used so far are machine-extracted and not valid for
  production decisions ("better than mempalace" needs a number). Smallest
  unblock: the user labels a stratified question set over the corpus, or
  approves a labeling protocol.

## Integrations

- [ ] Thin adapters over the CLI core: MCP server and per-agent hooks.
  Integrating a future agent must be an adapter, never an engine change.
- [ ] Early spike (deliberately promoted from phase 3): ChatGPT and Grok have
  no local transcript — design the remote-export adapter family before the
  local-file assumption hardens.
- [!] Windsurf and Trae remain unindexable at layer 1: the Windsurf exporter
  emits 0 conversations from its 4 database artifacts, and the Trae exporter
  emits VS Code workspace metadata instead of dialogue. Both filed in
  `~/p/rocket-agents/TODO.md`; smallest unblock is fixing those exporters
  (needs authorization to change that repo).

## Security

- [ ] Mark untrusted-origin content and never auto-inject it: brain stores
  saved web articles (third-party text), and a retrieved instruction inside one
  can steer a tool-bearing agent. Tag origin at ingest; requires no restriction
  on the user's own access. (Accepted Codex round-1 warning.)

## Self-improvement

- [ ] Query log, gap detection, and brain proposals — with the durable-state
  contradiction resolved first: layer 2 must stay disposable, so synthesis,
  query log and proposal state either live in brain or in an explicitly
  backed-up sidecar. As designed today a rebuild would erase them.

## Cross-project

- [ ] `rocket-agents`: canonical event IDs are conversation-local in practice —
  `conversationEventFromRecord.ts:20` derives them from `event_index + text`
  with no conversation identity, and real cross-conversation collisions were
  measured (OpenCode, Cursor). Atrium works around it with
  `sha256(conversation_id, event_id)`; the canonical contract should carry the
  identity itself. Also: the Windsurf exporter emits 0 conversations from 4
  database artifacts. Filed in `~/p/rocket-agents/TODO.md`.
- [ ] `mempalace` fork: the live palace embeds with the English-only default
  model over a ~77% Spanish corpus; switching to `embeddinggemma` (same 384
  dims, config-only) nearly doubles dense quality (R@10 40.8% -> 70.4%) at
  ~36 h CPU re-embed. Decision pending: worth doing while Atrium replaces it?
  Filed in `~/p/mempalace/TODO.md`.
